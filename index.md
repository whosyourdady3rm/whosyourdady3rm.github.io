## Welcome to whosyourdady3rm GitHub Web-page

My alias is **whosyourdady** and I started using GitHub in 2020, programming in the times of the pandemic that took the world by storm that year.

The programming languages I am most interested in are:
 - **C/C++**
 - **Java**
 - **Python**
 - **Go-Lang** (soon)
 

but I follow other areas also, like _drawing_, _editing videos_ or _blogging/literature_.

Also, _gaming_ is one of my top passions ever since I know computers.

More to come!

_Have some nice days ahead and thank you for passing by!_
